# Hello there!

**What is this?** This is the place to track data for loading into OpenSpending (including tracking down, scraping, cleaning that data!). You can use it to:

- Register a data set for someone (maybe you!) to work on in the future
- Find new load you could contribute to
- Update on progress you are making working on data
- Discuss any of the above!

*A note on the technology: in theory this is some kind of git repo (don’t worry if you don’t know what that is). However, we’re just using the [issue tracker](issues/) part of it -- there’s no code or any complex stuff.*

## Register new data for someone to work on

- Create a [new issue](issues/new)

Add info like:

- Add the source for a spending dataset that you would like to add to OpenSpending
- Describe the dataset: What does the dataset contain, what is the format of the data, does it need data cleaning or data wrangling

## Find data to work on

- Claim the dataset by assigning your self to the issue
- Ask for help from the community - see http://blog.openspending.org/contact/
- When its done mark the issue as Closed

## Discuss stuff

Just comment on one of the [issues][].
